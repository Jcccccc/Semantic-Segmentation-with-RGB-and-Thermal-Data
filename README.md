# Semantic-Segmentation-with-RGB-and-Thermal-Data

This is the DeepLabV3 part of project Semantic Segmentation of Outdoor Scenes utilizing Images Fusing RGB Channels with Thermal Channel. The report of the project can be visited at [https://github.com/glenndingli/Deep_Vision_Report](https://github.com/glenndingli/Deep_Vision_Report).

We clarify that we adapted the code of implementation of DeepLabV3 from Git Repo [https://github.com/ximimiao/deeplabv3-Tensorflow.git](https://github.com/ximimiao/deeplabv3-Tensorflow.git).
